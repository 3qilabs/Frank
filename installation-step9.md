### Step 7: Test 'er out!
You should be good to go at this point. Select the Frankified target
from the Scheme Selector (at the top, just to the right of the Run and
Stop buttons), then hit Run. You should see your app build and launch
as normal. But, if you now open up
[http://localhost:37265](http://localhost:37265) in a browser
you should see your app presented to you by Symbiote, the app
inspector embedded within Frank. That means you've successfully
Frankified your application. *Congratulations!*
