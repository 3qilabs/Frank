title: Installing Frank
---

To install Frank, follow these simple [Steps](installation-step1.html)

Alternatively, there is a [Screencast](http://vimeo.com/27691115) from Pete where you
can follow along.

Once you get your app [Frankified](installation-step3.html) you can [start writing user stories](supplied_steps.html) in
[Cucumber](http://cukes.info) and BDD your way to a better app :)

Happy testing with Frank!
