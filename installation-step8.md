You are almost done at this point. 

Select the Frankified target<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> from the Scheme Selector (at the top, just to the right of the Run and
Stop buttons), then hit Run. You should see your app build and launch as normal.

If you now open up [http://localhost:37265](http://localhost:37265) in a browser
you should see your app presented to you by Symbiote, the app
inspector embedded within Frank!

That means you've successfully Frankified your application. 

*Congratulations! You're ready to write [Cucumber stories](user_stories.html) and automate
 your iOS testing!*

**\[1\]** XCode might not show the right name in the Scheme Selector. In XCode 4.3, it shows *"YourAppName Copy"* instead
of *"YourAppName Frankified"* as it should!
