At this point, you should create an [XCode project for your app](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/Introduction/Introduction.html)
(unless you already have a project setup!!)

In a Terminal window, cd to your project directory (folder where the
.xcodeproj file lives) and run frank-skeleton: 

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd /path/to/my/awesome/app
$ frank-skeleton
{% endhighlight %}

This will add a `Frank` subdirectory containing Frank's server code plus some
initial cucumber plumbing to your app (after checking with you first!).
